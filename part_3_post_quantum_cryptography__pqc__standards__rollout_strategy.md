In the previous two parts of this article series, we have dealt with “_What_” and “_Why_” of **_Quantum Computing_**. You may access those articles from…

*   [**Part-1**](https://systemweakness.com/part-1-introduction-to-quantum-technology-0d43d13b9b26)**:** Quantum Computing Demystified.
*   [**Part-2**](https://medium.com/part-2-quantum-computing-demystified-1757f2ce38fc)**:** Quantum Computing Use Cases, Benefits & Limitations.

In **Part-3,** we cover how organizations can implement a successful PQC plan, highlighting key strategies, standards, and a technical checklist. This article more prescriptive than informative and it addresses the often-overlooked business and operational aspects of PQC. If you want to be successful in this project buckle-up and let's, go for the ride.

**_Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)_** a.k.a. **_Quantum-Safe Cryptography (QSC)_** acts as a critical, emerging layer in modern security standards, specifically designed to counter the threat quantum computing poses to traditional encryption methods like RSA and ECC.

Before we start, let us understand that this is a mandatory project as everybody is using “RSA Type” Cryptography and the expiry date on that encryption is coming up soon! It just doesn't matter if you are a small organization or just using service providers to manage your encryption needs. You will face the consequences, if an action is not taken now. The rest of this article explains what…
